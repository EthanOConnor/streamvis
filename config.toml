# Global configuration for streamvis.
#
# This file *is* wired into the runtime:
#   - Station bindings (`[stations.*].usgs_site_no`) populate SITE_MAP.
#   - `[global.usgs].iv_base_url` overrides the USGS IV base URL.
#   - Forecast URL templates come from `--forecast-base`, per-station
#     `forecast_endpoint`, or `[global.noaa_nwps].default_forecast_template`.
#
# Other fields (display_name, nws_lid, fast_changes, etc.) are currently
# advisory / future-facing; keep them up to date so we can wire them in
# without drift.
